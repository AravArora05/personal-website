        Honestly, I think this section may be a bit unnecessary. As programmers, we continuously must learn and adapt to new languages, syntax, and technologies every day. This ongoing learning process means that our skill set is always evolving. Additionally, we may occasionally forget certain syntax/concepts over time.
