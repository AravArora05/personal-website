# personal-website

This is a personal website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using `create-next-app`.  
The codebase is intentionally simple so that anyone can clone it, customize it, and use it as their own personal site.

## What This Project Is

- A minimal personal / portfolio website
- Built with the Next.js App Router
- Easy to adapt: swap in your own name, bio, links, and styles

If you want your own version, you can fork this repo, change the content, and redeploy.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- JavaScript
- `next/font` for font optimization
- Deployed via Vercel (or any other Next.js-compatible host)
